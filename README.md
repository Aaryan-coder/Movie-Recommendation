I have buikt this application using React.js, Firebase and Styled Components. 

I have built the following pages within this application: sign in, sign up, browse and the homepage. 

I have used firebase for database and for user authentication as well. Firebase firestore handles all the data and that data is retrieved using a custom hook. Authentication is used on all pages, which is handled by Firebase as well.

The styling done by styled components.
